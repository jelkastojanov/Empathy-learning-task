# Empathy learning task (ELT)

This repository stores the code for the Empathy learning task (ELT) associated with this pre-registration: https://aspredicted.org/9MH_W1W.

ELT attempts to mimic learning of intergroup empathic norms through observation. In the task, participants observe how individual ingroup and outgroup members emotionally respond to each other’s positive or negative outcomes. This task allows examination of how participants learn about operative intergroup empathic norms from individual observations of group members’ emotions and how they adapt to these norms in their own empathic responding.
